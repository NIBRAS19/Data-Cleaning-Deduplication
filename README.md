Quick Start Summary:

Install Python 3.8+ and add to PATH
Install required libraries: pip install pandas openpyxl xlrd
Create project structure with data/, scripts/, and output/ folders
Place your data files (file1.csv, file2.xlsx, file3.txt) in the data/ folder
Copy the main script to scripts/data_cleaner.py
Run the script: python scripts/data_cleaner.py

Key Features of the Setup:

Modular design: Easy to modify and extend
Error handling: Robust processing of different file formats
Comprehensive cleaning: Handles all requirements from your guide
Progress tracking: Shows what's happening during processing
Detailed output: Summary statistics and validation

File Structure You'll Have:
data-cleaning-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Your input files go here
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/        # The main cleaning script
â”œâ”€â”€ output/         # Cleaned results saved here
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
The script automatically handles:

âœ… Splitting combined fields (names, addresses)
âœ… Reordering shuffled columns
âœ… Phone number standardization with country codes
âœ… Email validation and whitespace trimming
âœ… Deduplication with smart record selection
âœ… Proper case formatting

Just follow the setup guide, place your data files in the correct folders, and run the script - it will process everything according to your specifications and save the cleaned results!

ðŸŽ¯ All Test Requirements Met:

âœ… Splits FullName and FullAddress from File 1
âœ… Reorders shuffled columns from File 3
âœ… Converts ALL CAPS to proper case
âœ… Trims extra spaces from emails
âœ… Removes invalid emails (no "@")
âœ… Standardizes phones with country codes (+33, +49, +44, +34, +39)
âœ… Deduplicates using OR logic (name+address OR email OR phone)
âœ… Keeps most complete record per duplicate group
âœ… Produces final clean CSV with exact required schema
